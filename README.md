## About The Project 
Poker Tracker is a platform where poker players can track their poker results and share it with other players.

It might take a while to load if the server has been inactive for a while.


## Motivation
At first the idea was just to create a sexier way to keep track of my poker scores rather than keeping it all in a spreadsheet.
I later realized that Svenska Spel has a rather large poker community but not a proper platform for the players to interact and share their results. 
Naturally I decided to expand the project to meet these needs.
